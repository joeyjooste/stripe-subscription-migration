## Stripe Subscription Migration Script

Welcome, this is a very simple script.

It takes a product and migrates all existing prices to a new price.

Example:

Lets say you have Product A.

Product A is being sold for $20 and $30 per month.

But you want to rather move everyone to $25 per month.

You would go into stripe and create a new Price for your product.

Now you realise you need a script to move the customers.

That's where this script comes in.

Simply enter the new Price_ID and it migrates everyone over.
